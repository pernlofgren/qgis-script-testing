This repo has been set up as a resource for automated testing of QGIS script tools.

`script_tools/identify_large_geometry_changes.py`: a geoprocessing script to identify changes between two versions of line data

### Travis Continuous Integration

Thanks to [Boundless QGIS Testing Environment](https://boundlessgeo.com/2016/07/qgis-continuous-integration-testing-environment-for-python-plugins/), testing inside a real QGIS session via a docker container is now possible!


The `.travis.yml` file in this repo customizes the steps for the testing environment and tells Travis what to do. All the steps are well documented in the Travis CI documentation, and all thats needed to trigger a new build is adding .travis.yml file, commit and push to the remote repo. In this example, builds only get triggered on master branch.
